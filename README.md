# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I had to create a program that can read a course planner and store different data structures.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I created multiple psuecodes of the different data structres the program was going to include.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I kept pushing myself to work on the project even if it was hard or if I need more time to work on it. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
By working on this project I leanred more about data structures and how to implement them.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project has helped me practice creating pseucode and futher develop my skills for testing and debugging.
